1. As an Admin, I want to be able to create an Account for my organization so that I can manage beer listings and invite other users to join the application.

2. As an Admin, I want to be able to invite users to join the application and assign them roles so that they can contribute to managing beer listings.

3. As an Admin or User, I want to be able to create a new beer listing with all the required details (hero image, beer type, brewery location, brewery history, description, interesting facts, and purchase locations) so that the beer can be displayed in the application.

4. As an Admin or User, I want to be able to edit existing beer listings to update any information or correct any errors.

5. As an Admin or User, I want to be able to delete beer listings that are no longer relevant or accurate.

6. As a Regular User, I want to be able to view the list of beers available in the application so that I can browse and find beers that interest me.

7. As a Regular User, I want to be able to view detailed information about a selected beer (including hero image, beer type, brewery location, brewery history, description, interesting facts, and purchase locations) so that I can learn more about the beer and decide if I want to try it.`;
